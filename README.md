# Dissertation

This folder contains proofs, written in VCC, about some s2n functions. Specifically, it contains proofs of memory safety and functional correctness for hmac.c, hash.c, stuffer.c, blob.c and mem.c.

VCC is a program verifier developed by Microsoft Research - for relevant papers, please visit https://vcc.codeplex.com .

I originally carried out for my MSc dissertation in 'Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science' at the University of Oxford in 2016, where I was supervised by Ernie Cohen.
