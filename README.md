# Dissertation

This repository contains proofs, written in VCC, about some s2n functions. Specifically, it contains proofs of memory safety and functional correctness for the HMAC construction.

VCC is a program verifier developed by Microsoft Research - for relevant papers, please visit https://vcc.codeplex.com .

I originally carried out this work for my MSc dissertation in 'Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science' at the University of Oxford in 2016.
